**Project** : Creation and querying of a database.

**1. Objective**

The purpose of this project is to create a database instance under a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and propose queries on this instance. The RDBMS used is MySQL. The topic is open, but the result must adhere to the constraints listed below.

**2. Constraints**

The following constraints must be respected:

- The database is related to a specific topic, i.e., the tables cannot be taken independently from each other.
- The database must contain at least 4 tables.
- Each table must contain at least 3 attributes.
- Each table must contain several tens of tuples, and at least one table must contain several hundreds of tuples.
- The data should have as little redundancy as possible.
- At least 2 queries should be written in each of the following categories:
  - Selection, projection, join 
  - Selection, projection, join, nesting 
  - Selection, projection, join, union 
  - Selection, projection, join, union, difference 
  - Division 
  - Selection, projection, join, aggregation 
  - Selection, projection, join, difference, aggregation 
  - Selection, projection, join, union, difference, aggregation

Each of the written queries should result in a non-empty response and be meaningful in the context of the topic being addressed.
